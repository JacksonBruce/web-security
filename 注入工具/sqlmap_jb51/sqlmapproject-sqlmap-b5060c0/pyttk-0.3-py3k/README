Ttk Python wrapper
==================

About
-----

This module provides classes to allow using the Tk themed widget set.

Ttk is based on a revised and enhanced version of
TIP #48 (http://tip.tcl.tk/48) specified style engine.

Its basic idea is to separate, to the extent possible, the code
implementing a widget's behavior from the code implementing its
appearance. Widget class bindings are primarily responsible for
maintaining the widget state and invoking callbacks, all aspects of
the widgets appearance lies at Themes.


Installing
----------

Just run:

# python setup.py install


Running Tests
-------------

After installing:

$ python test/runtests.py

or without installing:

$ PYTHONPATH=. python test/runtests.py


Requirements
------------

You will need Python with a _tkinter compiled against Tcl/Tk 8.5[1]
otherwise Tile[2] has to be installed. I have used this under Linux
with the py3k repo both with Tile and Tcl/Tk 8.5.


Samples
-------

Given that your system meet the requirements, you should be able to
run the samples (included in the pyttk-samples[3]) passing a proper
PYTHONPATH or placing the ttk module somewhere in sys.path (typically
by installing it).

If you are not sure if you have Tile installed correctly or if your
tkinter is compiled against Tk 8.5, see `Running Tests` above.

[1] I've shortly used it with Tcl/Tk 8.6a1 too.
[2] I've tested it with Tile 0.8.2 and it works, but I would recommend
    upgrading to Tcl/Tk 8.5 so you get antialiased fonts and other
    nice features. If you are testing this wrapper with Tile, it will
    look for the environment variable TILE_LIBRARY, which you can set
    to your tile library path if you installed it in a custom place.
